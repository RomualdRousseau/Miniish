Clock Relationships
*******************

Starting     Ending     |     rise to rise     |     fall to fall     |     rise to fall     |     fall to rise                     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
clk_0        clk_0      |     10.000           |     No paths         |     No paths         |     No paths                         
===================================================================================================================================
 Note: 'No paths' indicates there are no paths in the design for that pair of clock edges.
       'Diff grp' indicates that paths exist but the starting clock and ending clock are in different clock groups.
