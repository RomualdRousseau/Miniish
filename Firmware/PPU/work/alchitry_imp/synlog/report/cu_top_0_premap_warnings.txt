@W: MT529 :"/home/romuald/Projects/Miniish/Firmware/PPU/work/verilog/vga_ramdac_7.v":37:2:37:7|Found inferred clock vga_signals_6|pixel_clk_inferred_clock which controls 6 sequential elements including this_vga_ramdac.M_this_rgb_q[5:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
